# Predicting NBA Scoring Tiers with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict an NBA player's scoring tier (Low, Medium, or High) for individual games based on box-score statistics such as minutes played, shot attempts, shooting percentages, and other performance features.

## Project Structure

  Main Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and plots.

- `Final Project Machine Learning .pdf`  
  Final written report submitted for the course project.

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies for running the notebook.

## Dataset

The data consists of NBA game logs with box-score statistics for each player-game.
